# flashcard_mobile/ FLASH it (tentative lool)

`Converter`
- defined for page traversals (used in `Register/LoginPage.xaml`).

`Models`
- consists of classes used in the project (User, Deck, & Card).

`Services`
- `DataService.cs` & `DialogService.cs` were used for data handling and alter systems such as pop ups and the like.
- `DataService.cs` consists of the Disctionary the Users and List of Decks are stored per session (volatile memory so it'll disappear at the end of execution).
- logic for adding and getting user data is found here.
- CRUD operations on decks are also found here (will need revisions for whoever is in charge of creating, editing, and deleting a deck)

`ViewModels`
- instantiated in its corresponding `.xaml.cs` file.
- from my understanding, its like the middle man between the page `.xaml.cs` and `.xaml`.
- referencing in it's corresponding `.xaml.cs` file: `using flashcard_mobile.ViewModels;`
- referencing in it's corresponding `.xaml` file: `xmlns:viewModels="clr-namespace:flashcard_mobile.ViewModels"`

`Views`
- the actual pages
- `AccountPopup.xaml` is tied to the `My Account` text in the homepage, it's a drop down menu that should show `View Account`, `Edit Account`, and `Logout`.
- `Logout` already works, `View Account`, and `Edit Account` no ra and I didnt put any linkage lng sah.

`App.xaml.cs`
- Initialized `DataService` here

`AppShell.xaml`
- this is where the routes should be declared
- Ex: `<ShellContent Route="login" ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate views:LoginPage}" />`
- How the routes were used: `await Shell.Current.GoToAsync("//login");`
